## Minimal Docker image with Apache Tomcat forked from [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeanblanchard/docker-tomcat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeanblanchard/docker-tomcat)

Basic [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image to run [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/).
This is based on [Alpine Linux](http://alpinelinux.org/) to keep the size minimal.

* It listens on port 8080 and 8443 with a self signed certificate.
* A user **admin** is configured, with access to the _manager_ and _host-manager_ apps.
* User admin password is autogenerated, check instance logs
* !!Admin is available from any IP!!
* Documentation and examples have been removed.
